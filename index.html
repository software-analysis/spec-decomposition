    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>
      Software model checking has gained considerable momentum in the last decade.
      Major breakthroughs have increased its efficiency and effectiveness considerably
      such that this technology is now applicable to industrial-scale software.
      However, verifying the full formal specification of a software module
      is still considered too complex, and in practice, sets of properties are
      verified one by one in isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We propose an approach that takes the full formal specification as input
      and verifies <em>all properties simultaneously</em> in one verification run.
      Our verification algorithm monitors itself and detects situations for that
      the full set of properties is too complex.
      In such cases, we perform an <em>automatic decomposition</em>
      of the full set of properties into smaller sets,
      and the verification is seamlessly continued on the smaller sets.
      To avoid state-space explosion for large sets of properties,
      we introduce <em>on-the-fly property weaving</em>.
      Properties get weaved on the fly, along with the analysis;
      which properties to weave, or check, can be decided dynamically during the verification process.
    </p>
    <p>
      We perform an extensive evaluation based on verification
      tasks that were derived from 4336 Linux kernel modules,
      and a set of properties that define the correct usage of the Linux API.
      Checking several properties simultaneously can lead to a <em>significant increase
      of the efficiency</em>, due to the fact that abstract
      models share many parts among different properties.
    </div>

    <h2 id="data">Supplementary Data</h2>
    <p>
        We performed an extensive experimental evaluation to illustrate the potential
        and feasibility of our approach. The central parts of our replication package can be found here:

    <h2 id="reproducing">Reproducing the Results</h2>

    <h3>Prerequisites (Virtual Machine)</h3>

    <p>
      We have configured a virtual machine (based on an Ubuntu 16.04) which includes everything that is needed
      for reproducing our experimental results.
      The machine can be <a href="http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/se/stahlbauer/FSE16-spec-decomposition-updated.ova">downloaded here</a>.
      Both the <em>username</em>, and the <em>password</em>, is <strong>"fse"</strong> (without the quotes).
      The contents of the replication package can be found in the
      $BASE directory <tt>/home/fse/fse16-spec-decomposition</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Due to the limitations of the virtual machine (8 GB of RAM, 1 CPU core),
        the virtual machine ships with benchmark-definition files that specify
        lower resource requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>Prerequisites (Manually)</h3>

    <p>
        In the following we will explain how our experimental results can be reproduced.
        A detailed description of our benchmarking configuration can be
         found in the paper.
        We presume that you have a machine that meets (at least) the following
        requirements (other configurations could work as well):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Desktop operating system based on Linux 3.x</li>
        <li>OpenJDK 1.7 (or compatible)</li>
        <li><strong>32 GiB of RAM</strong> (less RAM would work in many cases; you would have to adjust some of the benchmark definition files manually)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        First of all, please choose the root directory <tt>$BASE</tt> to which we extract all the
        data and programs that are necessary to reproduce our results.
        This can be an arbitrary directory on your file system that can be written.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now you can retrieve a copy of our replication package and extract its contents to <tt>$BASE</tt>:
        Download the <a href="https://github.com/software-analysis/spec-decomposition/releases/download/FSE16/CPAchecker-package.zip">archive (compressed: 292 MB)</a> that includes all
        files for re-running our experiments, and extract them:
    <p>
<pre>
wget http://github.com/software-analysis/spec-decomposition/releases/download/FSE16/CPAchecker-package.zip
unzip CPAchecker-package.zip
export BASE=`pwd`
</pre>
    <p>
        The directory sub tree of <tt>$BASE</tt> should now contain, at least, following elements:
    </p>
<pre>
  .
  └── CPAchecker-package
      ├── config
      ├── doc
      ├── experiments
      │   ├── properties
      │   ├── tasks-main0
      │   └── tasks-main0-atleast2-rand250
      ├── lib
      └── scripts
</pre>


    <h3>Single Linux Kernel Module</h3>

    <p>
        We will now illustrate how to reproduce our results.
        Instead of describing the process for the full set of kernel modules
        tasks, we will discuss the process using the module
        <tt>drivers-isdn-gigaset-bas_gigaset-ko_main0.c</tt>
    </p>


<pre>
cd $BASE/CPAchecker-package
./scripts/cpa.sh -noout -heap 10000M -skipRecursion -disable-java-assertions \
    -mpa-alg-predicate-abelf \
    -setprop analysis.mpa.partition.time.cpu=900s \

    ./experiments/tasks-main0/drivers-isdn-gigaset-bas_gigaset-ko_main0.c
</pre>

    <p>
        The output of the command should look similar to the following:

    <h3>Characteristics of Java and the JVM</h3>
    <p>
        Since CPAchecker is written in Java, its performance depends on the JVM and its configuration.
        In cases where we compare several launches of CPAchecker, or multiple launches of the same
        code within CPAchecker, we have to consider the behaviour of the just-in-time compiler (JIT).
        In order to reduce the effect of the JIT as much as possible,
        we forced the JVM for some experiments to compile most of the byte code
        already during the startup.
        Starting CPAchecker with the argument <tt>-compile</tt> enables this behaviour
        by configuring the JVM with the arguments <tt>-Xcomp -XX:CompileThreshold=100</tt>.
    </p>

    <h3>Different Decomposition Strategies</h3>

    <p>
        The parameter <tt>analysis.mpa.partition.operator</tt> defines the decomposition strategy.
        In the following, we provide the configuration options for the strategies that were presented in the paper:
    </p>

<h4>Strategy S<sub>0</sub>: No Specification Decomposition</h4>

analysis.mpa.partition.time.cpu=900
</pre>

<h4>Strategy S<sub>2</sub>: All Simultaneously+Refinement Limit, Remaining Separately</h4>

    <h3>Running the Benchmark Suite</h3>
    <p>
        Our CPAchecker distribution includes a copy of <a href="https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec"><span class="tool">BenchExec</a>,
        a framework for reliable benchmarking and resource measurement.
        The script <tt>$BASE/CPAchecker-package/scripts/benchmark.py</tt> can to be started with a benchmark
        definition file as an argument; this will start a defined set of verification runs on the local machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        A benchmark definition file specifies
        (1) which verification tool to use,

        and the set of verification tasks, that is, (3) the set of properties to verify,

        As part of our replication package, we provide several of benchmark
        definition files (<a href="https://github.com/software-analysis/spec-decomposition/releases/download/FSE16/bench-defs.zip">ZIP archive</a>):

      <p>
      If you want to run, for example, the experiments that are defined in <tt>bench-baseline.xml</tt>, you can do
      this by running <tt>benchmark.py</tt> with the benchmark definition file as argument:
      </p>
<pre>
cd $BASE/CPAchecker-package
./scripts/benchmark.py ./experiments/bench-baseline.xml
</pre>

    <p>
        <strong>Before</strong> you can use CPAcheckers benchmarking infrastructure,
        and <span class="tool">BenchExec</span>, a number of system requirements have to be satisfied:
        <a href="https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md#system-requirements">BenchExec System Requirements</a>.
        It might be sufficient to setup the local Cgroups with the following commands:
    </p>
<pre>
sudo mount -t cgroup cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup
sudo chmod o+wt,g+w /sys/fs/cgroup/
</pre>

  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> The benchmarking script might complain that there is not sufficient memory installed:
  </p>
<pre>
Memory banks [0] do not have enough memory for one run, only 16704045056 bytes available.
</pre>

  <p>
      The benchmark definition files specify the requirements on the hardware; you might have to adjust them
      on your machine(s):
  </p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;benchmark tool="cpachecker" timelimit="1000" hardtimelimit="1100" <strong>memlimit="30GB" cpuCores="4"</strong>&gt;
  &lt;option name=<strong>"-heap"&gt;26000M</strong>&lt;/option&gt;
</code></pre>
